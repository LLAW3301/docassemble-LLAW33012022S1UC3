question: You are not eligible
subquestion: |
  It would appear you are not eligible to receive assistance from Uniting Communities at this time. This is because 
  % if applicant_age < 18 and state_of_residence == 'South Australia':
  you are under 18 years of age.
  % elif applicant_age > 65 and state_of_residence == 'South Australia':
  you are over 65 and, as such, do not meet the age requirement set out under s22 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013.
  %elif applicant_age_ok and state_of_residence != 'South Australia':
  you are not currently a resident of South Australia.
  % elif applicant_age < 18 and state_of_residence != 'South Australia':
  you are under 18 years of age and are not currently a resident of South Australia. 
  % elif applicant_age > 65 and state_of_residence != 'South Australia':
  you are over 65 and, as such, do not meet the age requirement set out under s22 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013. In addition to this, you are not currently a resident of South Australia.
